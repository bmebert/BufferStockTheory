  abstract  = "One theory of the determinants of individual and national thrift
               has come to be known as the life cycle hypothesis of saving. The
               state of the art on the eve of the formulation of the hypothesis
               some 30 years ago is reviewed. Then the theoretical foundations
               of the model in its original formulation and later amendment are
               set forth, calling attention to various implications, some
               distinctive to it and some counterintuitive. A number of crucial
               empirical tests, both at the individual and the aggregate level,
               are presented as well as some applications of the life cycle
               hypothesis of saving to current policy issues.",

@ARTICLE{Stachurski2019-gu,
  title    = "An impossibility theorem for wealth in heterogeneous-agent models
              with limited heterogeneity",
  author   = "Stachurski, John and Toda, Alexis Akira",
  abstract = "It has been conjectured that canonical Bewley--Huggett--Aiyagari
              heterogeneous-agent models cannot explain the joint distribution
              of income and wealth. The results stated below verify this
              conjecture and clarify its implications under very general
              conditions. We show in particular that if (i) agents are
              infinitely-lived, (ii) saving is risk-free, and (iii) agents have
              constant discount factors, then the wealth distribution inherits
              the tail behavior of income shocks (e.g., light-tailedness or the
              Pareto exponent). Our restrictions on utility require only that
              relative risk aversion is bounded, and a large variety of income
              processes are admitted. Our results show conclusively that it is
              necessary to go beyond standard models to explain the empirical
              fact that wealth is heavier-tailed than income. We demonstrate
              through examples that relaxing any of the above three conditions
              can generate Pareto tails.",

  abstract  = "Many issues in macroeconomics, such as the level of the steady
               state interest rate, or the dynamic effects of government
               deficit finance, depend crucially on the horizon of economic
               agents. This paper develops a simple analytical model in which
               such issues can be examined and in which the horizon of agents
               is a parameter which can be chosen arbitrarily.The first three
               sections of the paper characterize the dynamics and steady state
               of the economy in the absence of a government. The focus is on
               the effects of the horizon index on the economy. The paper
               clarifies in particular the separate roles of finite horizons
               and declining labor income through life in the determination of
               steady state interest rates.The next three sections study the
               effects and the role of fiscal policy.The focus is on the
               effects of deficit finance both in closed and open economies.
               The paper clarifies the respective roles of government spending,
               deficits and debt in the determination of interest rates.",

  abstract  = "In a model calibrated to match micro- and macroeconomic evidence
               on household income dynamics, we show that a modest degree of
               heterogeneity in household preferences or beliefs is sufficient
               to match empirical measures of wealth inequality in the United
               States. The heterogeneity-augmented model's predictions are
               consistent with microeconomic evidence that suggests that the
               annual marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is much larger than
               the roughly 0.04 implied by commonly used macroeconomic models
               (even ones including some heterogeneity). The high MPC arises
               because many consumers hold little wealth despite having a
               strong precautionary motive. Our model also plausibly predicts
               that the aggregate MPC can differ greatly depending on how the
               shock is distributed across households (depending, e.g., on
               their wealth, or employment status).",

               incorporates the effect that permanent income shocks have on
               macroeconomic aggregates. With the permanent-income-neutral
               measure, one does not need to keep track of the permanent-income
               distribution. The permanent-income-neutral measure is both
               useful for the analytical characterization of aggregate
               consumption-savings behavior and for simulating numerical

  abstract  = "We provide the analytical explanation of the interactions
               between precautionary saving and liquidity constraints. The
               effects of liquidity constraints and risks are similar because
               both stem from the same source: a concavification of the
               consumption function. Since a more concave consumption function
               exhibits heightened prudence, both constraints and risks
               strengthen the precautionary saving motive. In addition, we
               explain the apparently contradictory results that constraints
               and risks in some cases intensify, but in other cases weaken the
               precautionary saving motive. The central insight is that the
               effect of introducing an additional constraint or risk depends
               on whether it interacts with preexisting constraints or risks.
               If it does not interact with any preexisting constraints or
               risks, it intensifies the precautionary motive. If it does
               interact, it may reduce the precautionary motive in earlier
               periods at some levels of wealth.",

               unique thread of presentation leading the reader safely into the
               wonderfully rich, expressive, and powerful theory of
               categories.'' --- The Math Association Category theory has
               provided the foundations for many of the twentieth century's
               greatest advances in pure mathematics. This concise, original
               text for a one-semester course on the subject is derived from
               courses that author Emily Riehl taught at Harvard and Johns
               Hopkins Universities. The treatment introduces the essential
               concepts of category theory: categories, functors, natural
               transformations, the Yoneda lemma, limits and colimits,
               adjunctions, monads, and other topics. Suitable for advanced
               undergraduates and graduate students in mathematics, the text
               provides tools for understanding and attacking difficult
               problems in algebra, number theory, algebraic geometry, and
               algebraic topology. Drawing upon a broad range of mathematical
               examples from the categorical perspective, the author
               illustrates how the concepts and constructions of category
               theory arise from and illuminate more basic mathematical ideas.

  abstract  = "[This paper is concerned with the theory of saving when
               consumers are not permitted to borrow, and with the ability of
               such a theory to account for some of the stylized facts of
               saving behavior. When consumers are relatively impatient, and
               when labor income is independently and identically distributed
               over time, assets act like a buffer stock, protecting
               consumption against bad draws of income. The precautionary
               demand for saving interacts with the borrowing constraints to
               provide a motive for holding assets. If the income process is
               positively autocorrelated, but stationary, assets are still used
               to buffer consumption, but do so less effectively and at a
               greater cost in terms of foregone consumption. In the limit,
               when labor income is a random walk, it is optimal for impatient
               liquidity constrained consumers simply to consume their incomes.
               As a consequence, a liquidity constrained representative agent
               cannot generate aggregate U.S. saving behavior if that agent
               receives aggregate labor income. Either there is no saving, when
               income is a random walk, or saving is contracyclical over the
               business cycle, when income changes are positively
               autocorrelated. However, in reality, microeconomic income
               processes do not resemble their average, and it is possible to
               construct a model of microeconomic saving under liquidity
               constraints which, at the aggregate level, reproduces many of
               the stylized facts in the actual data. While it is clear that
               many households are not liquidity constrained, and do not behave
               as described here, the models presented in the paper seem to
               account for important aspects of reality that are not explained

               features of the covariance structure of earnings and hours
               changes. We find that this structure is very similar across data
               sets, and may be adequately summarized by a simple
               components-of-variance model, consisting of (i) serially

               earnings and hours with a second-order moving average covariance
               structure, and (iii) a nonstationary component that affects only
               the variances and contemporaneous covariances of earnings and
               hours. In the second part of the paper we offer an
               interpretation of this model in terms of a simple life-cycle
               labor supply model. On the assumption that we can identify

               choose to exhaust their borrowing capacity from time to time.
               Yet, due to technical limitations, the conditions under which
               this behavior arises have not been investigated. The present
               paper extends the class of solvable models in a way that allows
               this issue to be dealt with. It turns out that under the loosest
               sustainable borrowing constraint, the agent might systematically
               avoid exhausting his borrowing capacity.",

  abstract  = "The small open economy model with incomplete asset markets
               features a steady-state that depends on initial conditions and
               equilibrium dynamics that possess a random walk component. A
               number of modifications to the standard model have been proposed
               to induce stationarity. This paper presents a quantitative
               comparison of these alternative approaches. Five different
               specifications are considered: (1) A model with an endogenous
               discount factor (Uzawa-type preferences); (2) a model with a
               debt-elastic interest-rate premium; (3) a model with convex
               portfolio adjustment costs; (4) a model with complete asset
               markets; and (5) a model without stationarity-inducing features.
               The main finding of the paper is that all models deliver
               virtually identical dynamics at business-cycle frequencies, as
               measured by unconditional second moments and impulse response
               functions. The only noticeable difference among the alternative
               specifications is that the complete-asset-market model induces
               smoother consumption dynamics.",

                 household income, wealth, and preference heterogeneity amplify
                 and propagate a macroeconomic shock. We focus on the U.S.
                 Great Recession of 2007-2009 and proceed in two steps. First,
                 using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we
                 document the patterns of household income, consumption and
                 wealth inequality before and during the Great Recession. We
                 then investigate how households in different segments of the
                 wealth distribution were affected by income declines, and how
                 they changed their expenditures differentially during the
                 aggregate downturn. Motivated by this evidence, we study
                 several variants of a standard heterogeneous household model
                 with aggregate shocks and an endogenous cross-sectional wealth
                 distribution. Our key finding is that wealth inequality can
                 significantly amplify the impact of an aggregate shock, and it
                 does so if the distribution features a sufficiently large
                 fraction of households with very little net worth that sharply
                 increase their saving (i.e. they are not hand-to mouth) as the
                 recession hits. We document that both these features are
                 observed in the PSID. We also investigate the role that social
                 insurance policies, such as unemployment insurance, play in
                 shaping the cross-sectional income and wealth distribution,

               evidence and a valid instrument in the hands of future economic
               researchers and policy makers? In this volume a distinguished
               American economist presents a new theory of the consumption
               function, tests it against extensive statistical J material and
               suggests some of its significant implications. Central to the
               new theory is its sharp distinction between two concepts of
               income, measured income, or that which is recorded for a
               particular period, and permanent income, a longer-period concept
               in terms of which consumers decide how much to spend and how
               much to save. Milton Friedman suggests that the total amount
               spent on consumption is on the average the same fraction of
               permanent income, regardless of the size of permanent income.
               The magnitude of the fraction depends on variables such as
               interest rate, degree of uncertainty relating to occupation,
               ratio of wealth to income, family size, and so on. The
               hypothesis is shown to be consistent with budget studies and
               time series data, and some of its far-reaching implications are
